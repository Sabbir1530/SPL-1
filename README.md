This project report describes the development and evaluation of two predictive models built using the C programming language: one for estimating house prices and
another for forecasting weather conditions. The house price model uses multiple
linear regression, a statistical method to predict a continuous outcome, to estimate prices based on seven property features, achieving 88.33% accuracy within a
$10,000 error margin. The weather forecasting model combines linear regression
for predicting temperature and logistic regression, a method for binary classification, for predicting rain probability, reaching 81.00% accuracy for rain predictions.
Both models process data from CSV files, normalize features to ensure fair comparisons, calculate coefficients using matrix algebra, and present results through
simple text-based interfaces. Challenges such as assumptions of linear relationships, memory management in C, and computational efficiency are discussed, with
solutions like adding non-linear features and using optimized libraries proposed.
This work demonstrates the effectiveness of C for statistical modeling in resourcelimited settings and highlights the practical applications of regression in real estate
and meteorology.
